// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a(generic code)...

1. Start
2. Read the first number (num1)
3. Read the second number (num2)
4. Set the sum (result) to 0
5. Add num1 and num2, and store the result in the variable result
6. Display the value of result
7. Stop

b(plugging in num1 = 5, num2 = 3)...

1. Start
2. Read the first number (num1)  -> Let's say num1 = 5
3. Read the second number (num2) -> Let's say num2 = 3
4. Set the sum (result) to 0
5. Add num1 and num2, and store the result in the variable result -> result = num1 + num2 = 5 + 3 = 8
6. Display the value of result -> Display 8
7. Stop

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Start
2. Read the number (num)
3. If num modulo 2 equals 0, then
     - Display "The number is even"
   Else
     - Display "The number is odd"
4. Stop

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a(generic code)...

1. Start
2. Read the first number (num1)
3. Read the second number (num2)
4. Read the third number (num3)
5. Read the fourth number (num4)
6. Read the fifth number (num5)
7. Set the sum (total) to 0
8. Add num1, num2, num3, num4, and num5, and store the result in the variable total
9. Set the average to total divided by 5
10. Set the minimum to num1
11. Set the maximum to num1
12. If num2 is less than minimum, then set minimum to num2
13. If num2 is greater than maximum, then set maximum to num2
14. If num3 is less than minimum, then set minimum to num3
15. If num3 is greater than maximum, then set maximum to num3
16. If num4 is less than minimum, then set minimum to num4
17. If num4 is greater than maximum, then set maximum to num4
18. If num5 is less than minimum, then set minimum to num5
19. If num5 is greater than maximum, then set maximum to num5
20. Display "The average is: " concatenated with the value of average
21. Display "The minimum number is: " concatenated with the value of minimum
22. Display "The maximum number is: " concatenated with the value of maximum
23. Stop

b(plugging in num1 = 10, num2 = 5, num3 = 8, num4 = 12, num5 = 3)...

1. Start
2. Read the first number (num1) -> Let's say num1 = 10
3. Read the second number (num2) -> Let's say num2 = 5
4. Read the third number (num3) -> Let's say num3 = 8
5. Read the fourth number (num4) -> Let's say num4 = 12
6. Read the fifth number (num5) -> Let's say num5 = 3
7. Set the sum (total) to 0
8. Add num1, num2, num3, num4, and num5, and store the result in the variable total -> total = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = 10 + 5 + 8 + 12 + 3 = 38
9. Set the average to total divided by 5 -> average = total / 5 = 38 / 5 = 7.6
10. Set the minimum to num1 -> minimum = num1 = 10
11. Set the maximum to num1 -> maximum = num1 = 10
12. If num2 is less than minimum, then set minimum to num2
13. If num2 is greater than maximum, then set maximum to num2
14. If num3 is less than minimum, then set minimum to num3
15. If num3 is greater than maximum, then set maximum to num3
16. If num4 is less than minimum, then set minimum to num4
17. If num4 is greater than maximum, then set maximum to num4
18. If num5 is less than minimum, then set minimum to num5
19. If num5 is greater than maximum, then set maximum to num5
20. Display "The average is: " concatenated with the value of average -> Display "The average is: 7.6"
21. Display "The minimum number is: " concatenated with the value of minimum -> Display "The minimum number is: 3"
